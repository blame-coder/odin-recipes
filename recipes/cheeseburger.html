      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>A cheeseburger is a hamburger with a slice of melted cheese on top of the meat patty, added near the end of the cooking time. Cheeseburgers can include variations in structure, ingredients and composition.</p>
    
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul><li>1 lb of Ground Beef</li>
        <li>  1 small onion</li>
        <li>  1/4 cup cream</li>
        <li>  1 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>  salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>  4 slices Cheese (melting cheese of your choice)</li>
        <li>  Lettuce and tomato for topping</li></ul>
          

        

      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol><li>Place ground beef in bowl. Grate onion directly over beef, letting onion juice fall into bowl with beef, (grating until you get about 1/4 cup grated onion).</li>
        <li>  Add cream to beef. Mix gently but thoroughly. Divide into 4 equal portions and gently form into burger patties.</li>
        <li>  Heat butter in heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When foam subsides, add patties to pan. Reduce heat to medium.</li>
        <li>  Cook burger patties 2 1/2 minutes (for medium rare) on first side basting with butter. Carefully flip to other side. Cook additional 2 1/2 minutes, continuing to baste. Add a slice of your favorite cheese and let it melt. Remove from pan. Garnish with lettuce and tomato and serve on bread, such as a baguette.</li></ol>
